# SHOOTING INTERLOCK SAFETY FEATURES
# ============================================================
# These prevent the robot from shooting in certain conditions
# to ensure clean data collection and proper optimization

[shooting_interlocks]
# Block shooting until the previous shot has been logged as hit or miss
# When enabled, robot cannot shoot again until driver clicks LogHit or LogMiss
# DEFAULT: False (disabled) - drivers can shoot freely
# ENABLE THIS: For maximum data quality, forces logging of every shot
require_shot_logged = False

# Block shooting until Bayesian calculations complete and coefficients update
# When enabled, robot waits for tuner to finish optimization before next shot
# DEFAULT: False (disabled) - shooting and tuning happen independently  
# ENABLE THIS: For sequential testing, ensures each shot uses updated coefficients
require_coefficients_updated = False
